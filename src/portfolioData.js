    "aboutme":"   Living and loving in the American Northeast, I've been incredibly fortunate to have traveled the world at a very young age. I credit my lust for life and aesthetic sensibility to the countries and cultures that have shaped me. As I continue to travel, I strive to bring it all together in my work. I'm inspired by the idea of creating something out of nothing, finding beauty in every detail, and working tirelessly towards a goal. As a developer, I have been fortunate to take part in numerous collaborative builds, from concept to deployment, with both junior and senior developers. I really love being part of a team, working with creative minds, learning new skills and ultimately-- launching the finished product.",
